# Test Directory

This is a test directory created to demonstrate the pre-commit hook functionality in the ALXprodev-advanced_git repository.

## Purpose

This directory serves as an example of how the GitFlow workflow and Git hooks work together to maintain code quality and documentation standards.

## Contents

- `test.txt` - A sample test file demonstrating the pre-commit hook behavior

## Pre-commit Hook Testing

This directory was initially created without a README file to test the pre-commit hook that ensures all directories contain proper documentation. The hook successfully prevented commits until this README was added.

## GitFlow Integration

This directory follows the same GitFlow principles as the rest of the repository:
- Created from the develop branch
- Follows proper commit message conventions
- Maintains documentation standards through automated hooks
